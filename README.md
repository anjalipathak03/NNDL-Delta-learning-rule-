# Delta-learning-rule

The delta rule in an artificial neural network is a specific kind of backpropagation that assists in refining the machine learning/artificial intelligence network, making associations among input and outputs with different layers of artificial neurons. 

Generally, backpropagation has to do with recalculating input weights for artificial neurons utilizing a gradient technique. Delta learning does this by using the difference between a target activation and an obtained activation. By using a linear activation function, network connections are balanced. Another approach to explain the Delta rule is that it uses an error function to perform gradient descent learning.
